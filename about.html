                    After studying mathematics and music at UNC Chapel Hill, I travelled extensively throughout Central America, SE Asia, Africa, and China before and during the my 11-year career in education. I grew up loving video games which sparked my interested in developing
                    games and applications. Since 8th grade I've been playing guitar professionally as a side gig in several local projects, and continue to do so. I finally put two and two together and realized my passions and experiences all had something
                    in common: Coding.
                    <p>Its never too late, and I am living proof as I dive head first into the field having acquired the skills needed in today's world to be a Full-Stack Developer with a focus on music, innovation, and education.
                        <p> I have always be an effective and friendly communicator who collaborates with others on all organizational levels to achieve specific goals and company objectives. With a mind driven by math and music, there is a never-ending creativity
                            and originality that makes me an ideal team member who has continually increased my former colleagues successes while increasing workflows. My strong work ethic and fun personality have make former employers sad to go down
                            my path which has led me to this long overdue but increasingly exciting career in web development.
                            <p> Some of my key strengths and skills include:
