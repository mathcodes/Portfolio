                    After studying mathematics and music at UNC Chapel Hill, I travelled extensively throughout <span style="color:#d35400; font-weight:bold">Central America, Thailand, Indonesia, Africa, and China</span> before and during the my 11-year
                    career in education. Travel has given me chances to put things into perspective and the time and mindset to create. <br> </br>I grew up loving <span style="color:#d35400; font-weight:bold">video games</span> which sparked my interested
                    in developing games and applications. Since 8th grade I've been playing guitar professionally as a side gig in several local projects, and continue to do so. I finally put two and two together and realized my passions and experiences
                    all had something in common: <span style="color:#d35400; font-weight:bold">Coding</span>.
                    <br> </br>Its never too late, and I am living proof as I head into the field having acquired the skills needed in today's world to be a <span style="color:#d35400; font-weight:bold">Full-Stack Developer</span> with a focus on music,
                    innovation, and education.
                    <br> </br>I have always be an effective and friendly communicator who collaborates with others on all organizational levels to achieve specific goals and company objectives. With a mind driven by math and music, there is a never-ending
                    creativity and originality that makes me an ideal team member who has continually increased my former colleagues successes while increasing workflows. My strong work ethic and fun personality have already proven to be great assets.
                    One example is working with others in projects, which comes naturally to me having worked for and with a diverse group of people and experiences all with which has led me to this long overdue but increasingly exciting career in web
                    development.
                    <br> </br>Some of my <span style="color:#d35400; font-weight:bold">key strengths</span> and <span style="color:#d35400; font-weight:bold">skills </span> include:
